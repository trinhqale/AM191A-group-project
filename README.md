Our project seeks to address the social problem of gender inequality, specifically pertaining to the lack of opportunities in leadership that women face on a daily basis. Through our mapplication, we hope to empower women and highlight their struggles in representation by drawing attention to areas that could progress to a more equitable environment. While developing this tool, our group project may encounter technical challenges such as ensuring that the mapplication is user-friendly and is accessible to people of different backgrounds and disabilities. Another technical challenge we may encounter is addressing the issue of scalability, as the mapplicationâ€™s user base grows and more data needs to be added. Some ethical problems that will be taken into consideration while producing the mapplication is ensuring a fair and unbiased presentation of data and analysis, making sure that the mapplication is not used to discriminate against individuals or groups, and by observing user privacy. We plan to reach out to various non-profit organizations ranging from a global level [UN Women](https://data.unwomen.org) and the [American Association of University Women](https://www.aauw.org/contact-us/) to student-ran clubs on campus (She Can Do It and FEM Newsmagazine), that all share the same goal of female empowerment.
