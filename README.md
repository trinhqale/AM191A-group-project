## Objective
The objective of our project is to provide a platform where female faculty at UCLA—both caregivers and single women—can anonymously share their experiences with their commute and work-life balance. There is a lot of focus on female faculty and staff gaining enriching experiences in schools like UCLA, but many have family responsibilities as well as economic, cultural, physical, and psychological obstacles that impact their work-life balance. Overall, our hope is that this project brings more female faculty and staff together in sharing their experiences with their commute and work-life balance in a way that can be shared with future generations of women coming to UCLA.

## Who is being empowered
Our mapplication is intended to empower female faculty at UCLA, including both caregivers with dependents and single women, as both groups will benefit from an increased awareness about the commutes of female faculty and their personal experiences with work-life balance.
