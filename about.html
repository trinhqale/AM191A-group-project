       <h2>Who is empowered and how?</h2>
       <p><strong style="font-weight: 3000;">Girls just want to have fun</strong> is a map application that aims to empower female faculty at UCLA, including caregivers and non-caregivers. In the context of our project, caregivers are people who have the added responsibility of taking care of children or loved ones, while non-caregivers do not have this responsibility. Our project highlights the experiences of being a female faculty member at UCLA and how factors such as their commute affect their work-life balance. Overall, our project seeks to empower by encouraging female faculty at UCLA to share their experiences with their commute and work-life balance in a way that can be shared with future generations of women coming to UCLA.</p>
       
       <h2>What ethical considerations were taken into consideration in creating this application?</h2>
        <p>Our project observed data justice principles and prioritized protecting the privacy of the participants by anonymizing their data and ensuring it is stored securely. We approached the topic of work-life balance and commute experiences with respect and sensitivity, by encouraging participants to share their experiences voluntarily and ensuring that their stories were presented in a respectful manner.</p>
       
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Women face transportation challenges that limit their work-life balance, traveling less frequently and for shorter durations than men, primarily for household-related purposes. They tend to rely more on car travel to balance work and home obligations. Gender disparities are evident in public transportation use, with women adapting their travel behavior accordingly. Despite these significant gender gaps, the UCLA Transportation Annual Report does not include gender-specific commuter data. Additionally, the UCLA Office of Faculty Development and Diversity (OFDD) lacks an annual report addressing gendered commuter characteristics and work-life balance. Given that 39% of UCLA faculty staff identify as female in the 2018-2019 academic year, it is crucial to shed light on this underrepresented narrative.</p>
