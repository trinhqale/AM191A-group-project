       <p><strong style="font-weight: 3000;">Girls just want to have fun</strong> is a map application that aims to empower female faculty at UCLA, including caregivers and non-caregivers. In the context of our project, caregivers are people who have the added responsibility of taking care of children or loved ones, while non-caregivers do not have this responsibility. Our project highlights the experiences of being a female faculty member at UCLA and how factors such as their commute affect their work-life balance. Overall, our project seeks to empower by encouraging female faculty at UCLA to share their experiences with their commute and work-life balance in a way that can be shared with future generations of women coming to UCLA.</p>
       <h2>What ethical considerations were taken into consideration in creating this application?</h2>
      <p>Our project observed data justice principles and prioritized protecting the privacy of the participants by anonymizing their data and ensuring it is stored securely. We approached the topic of work-life balance and commute experiences with respect and sensitivity, by encouraging participants to share their experiences voluntarily and ensuring that their stories were presented in a respectful manner.</p>
