        <h2>Who is this project empowering and how? </h2>
        <p><strong style="font-weight: 3000;">Girls just want to have fun</strong> is a map application that aims to empower female faculty at UCLA, including caregivers and non-caregivers. In the context of our project, caregivers are people who have the added responsibility of taking care of children or loved ones, while non-caregivers do not have this responsibility. Our project project highlights the experiences of being a female faculty member at UCLA and how factors such as their commute affect their work-life balance. Overall, our project seeks to empower by encouraging female faculty at UCLA to share their experiences with their commute and work-life balance in a way that can be shared with future generations of women coming to UCLA.</p>
        <h2>Who is being empowered?</h2>
       <p>Our project will empower the general UCLA student community, including both current and future Bruins, as both groups will benefit from increased awareness about waste habits, reduction, and impact. Community members concerned about sustainability and waste reduction, as well as those less aware of the consistent waste problem will have their voices and personal experiences shared. Additionally, students living on and off-campus will be able to share their experiences, accounting for the varying habits and resources available for the two groups.</p>
      
       <h2>What Technology is being Used?</h2>
       <p>In this project, we use software such as Leaflet and Papaparse to create our map and import the survey data. Additionally, we utilize multiple programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create and maintain this mapplication.</p>
      
       <h2>Limitations</h2>
       <p>Even though we do our best to consider design and data justice as we build this mapplication and continue to improve on it, there are technical and ethical problems that could occur in the development and further use of this tool. Although we narrowed our scope to target only students, there are still a wide variety of experiences and backgrounds within this community in regard to waste management and information. Thus, beginning with a smaller sample, the stories we receive may not represent every single perspective out there. Some technical problems that could occur are issues with mostly blank survey responses. Since a majority of our questions are not required, this could lead to some incomplete profiles.</p>
      
       <h2>How can you use this Project in the Future?</h2>
       <p>UCLA students and future community members can use this mapplication to gain a deeper understanding of the different perspectives surrounding waste management on campus. As more students add their stories, hopefully, future students will be able to use this as a tool to gauge how the student body is feeling towards UCLA's goals. It can also be a place to see that they are not alone in their feelings towards the current program. UCLA Sustainability and other campus environmental organizations can utilize our project to gather data on public perception and potentially try out some of the suggested solutions from the responses. By returning to the website to click and read through student stories, as well as adding their own, student community members and UCLA admin can better understand where students are coming from and enact change.</p>
